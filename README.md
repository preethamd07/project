The approach we are looking for outlines a strategy for building a responsive website using CSS Grid and Flexbox,
by using these two tools we can design and develope a fluid and adaptable web layouts.
<br>
As we will be using CSS grid and flex box, we will have an oppurtunity to use both two dimensional and single dimensional layouts.
<br>
So we will be using Grid to evenly place all the blocks in such a way that it get adjusted based on the dashboard's layout.
<br>
Simmilarly we make use of flex to place the contents coloumnwise inside the blocks with proper alignment.
